# Style Guide for Faberlic Satire RAG Project

## Project Tone & Voice

- **Overall Tone**: Satirical, witty, and playful, but never malicious or genuinely harmful
- **Attitude**: Affectionate mockery of Faberlic culture and beauty industry conventions
- **Audience**: Primarily Russian-speaking satire enthusiasts familiar with Faberlic cosmetics brand
- **Goal**: Entertain while subtly promoting affiliate products through humorous contexts

## General Content Rules

1. **Humor Style**: Use observational humor, irony, and exaggeration
2. **Language Level**: Mix formal and colloquial Russian for comedic effect
3. **Length Variety**: Balance short, punchy posts with longer analytical pieces
4. **Affiliate Integration**: Weave product recommendations naturally into satirical narratives
5. **Sensitivity**: Avoid crossing into mean-spirited territory; punch up, not down

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Dzen (Яндекс Дзен)

**Format**: Article-based, medium-length posts (500-1500 words)

**Title Style**:
- Clickbait-friendly but truthful headlines
- Use numbers when applicable: "5 Faberlic Products That Actually Work (Unlike Your Relationships)"
- Include platform-specific keywords for SEO

**Structure**:
1. Hook with a relatable observation
2. 3-4 main points with humor
3. Product integration through storytelling
4. Call-to-action link to affiliate product
5. Engagement-driving conclusion question

**Tone Adjustments**: Slightly more "clickbaity" to match platform culture, use more emojis in preview text

### Telegram

**Format**: Short, snappy posts and threads (100-300 characters per message)

**Style**:
- Use ALL CAPS sparingly for emphasis
- Emojis are essential for visual interest
- Break long thoughts into bullet points
- Include stickers/GIFs where relevant

**Call-to-Action**:
- Direct affiliate links in pinned posts
- "Swipe up" style CTAs (mentioning they should click link in bio)
- Product recommendations as casual mentions

**Posting Frequency**: Daily short posts, 2-3 threads per week

### Medium

**Format**: Long-form articles (1500-3000 words), more editorial tone

**Language**: English, more technical and analytical

**Style**:
- Academic-like structure with sections and subheadings
- Use blockquotes for emphasis
- Include data/statistics when possible
- Code snippets or examples where relevant

**Tone Adjustments**:
- More cerebral humor (meta-commentary on influencer culture)
- Assume English-speaking audience less familiar with Faberlic
- Longer product explanations and benefits
- Include link to affiliate products in conclusion

### WordPress Blog

**Format**: SEO-optimized posts (800-2000 words), evergreen content

**Structure**:
- Clear H1, H2, H3 hierarchy
- Meta description (155-160 characters) optimized for CTR
- Internal linking to other blog posts
- Featured image requirements
- "Keyword stuffing" cautiously for SEO without losing readability

**Style**:
- More formal than Dzen, but still satirical

- Comments section encouraged

**Content Types**:
- How-to guides ("How to Use Faberlic Serum Without Becoming a Skincare Cult Member")

- "Myth Busting" pieces
- Personal testimonials with satirical framing

## Visual Style

- **Color Palette**: Use Faberlic-associated colors (purples, golds) in graphics

- **Image Treatment**: High-quality but intentionally "imperfect" (real people, genuine moments)
- **Branding**: Consistent watermarks/logos on all images

## Hashtag Strategy
